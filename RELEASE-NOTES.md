# VGT GeDefense 1.0.0-beta.5

**GeDefense powered by VisionGaiaTechnology** is the first branded and encrypted full-stack beta.

The release preserves the existing Command Center design and gives the public login the same visual identity, versioning and security language. German, English and Russian are available without loading external assets. The optional support panel contains only operator-visible addresses and a direct PayPal link; no payment SDK or tracker is embedded.

Sensitive operational state is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. AAD binds every envelope to its schema, node, purpose, canonical storage path and sequence. Separate HMAC-derived subkeys prevent cross-purpose ciphertext reuse. New gateway credentials use Argon2id; valid legacy PBKDF2 records are upgraded after successful login.

The security pass covers browser XSS sinks, CSP, CSRF, login/session bypass, Host-header routing, reverse-proxy header leakage, backend bearer isolation, SSRF, path handling, RCE primitives and encrypted-state tampering. Automated regression tests and `scripts/security-audit.sh` enforce the critical properties.

The release still reports full-stack installation success only after the target host compiles the Rust core and eBPF object, the destination kernel verifier accepts XDP, the interface attachment succeeds and authenticated Go/Rust IPC reports the core online.

Swarm/Mesh remains intentionally outside this beta.
